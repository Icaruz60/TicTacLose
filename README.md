My third version of Tic-tac-toe is a sprite based 1 player game, where 1 player can play tic-tac-toe against an unbeatable Bot, that always does the most optimal move using a min-max algorithm forcing either a win or a tie. This code features the following:
A 500x500 pygame display that shows a tic-tac-toe grid and can be interacted with by clicking in the fields using your mouse.
When the grid is full (no more possible moves) the grid resets and the bot has the starting move. The program can also detect a win for either side. It will display a win message and then reset the game. For detailed information about how the code works, read the code below. Every line/section is commented and explains what it does
